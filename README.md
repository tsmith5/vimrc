# .vimrc
This is my JS-focused VIM config which I am currently running on MacOS. It should work on any OS, with maybe some minor changes to keybinds.

## Dependencies

1. Vim (obviously)
2. [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
3. [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
4. A decent terminal emulator with support for Powerline fonts and their symbols

## Install

1. Replace the default vimrc with this one. On UNIX it's pretty typically found in ~/.vimrc, or in %AppData% on Windows.
2. Go through the file and change any hotkeys or directory paths that you don't like
3. Open the file in vim and type `:PlugInstall` then restart vim.
